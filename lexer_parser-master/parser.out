Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> expression PLUS term
Rule 2     expression -> term
Rule 3     term -> term TIMES factor
Rule 4     term -> factor
Rule 5     factor -> NUMBER
Rule 6     factor -> LPAREN expression RPAREN

Terminals, with rules where they appear

LPAREN               : 6
NUMBER               : 5
PLUS                 : 1
RPAREN               : 6
TIMES                : 3
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 1 6 0
factor               : 3 4
term                 : 1 2 3
